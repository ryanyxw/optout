he recalls, with a hint of nostalgic mischievousness, in the opening pages of his book on Deleuze.2 In those days, Badiou was a young lecturer in the philosophy department, with no philosophical _oeuvre_ to speak of behind him: two novels, one slim volume published in the celebrated _Théorie_ series directed by Althusser, and two essays, which he himself classifies as 'political', not philosophical texts, in a short-lived series directed by Sylvain Lazarus and himself with the same left-wing publisher, François Maspéro.3 But he had years of political militancy behind him, first in a small left-wing socialist party, the _Parti Socialiste Unifié_ ( _PSU_ ), then in a small Maoist group called UCF (m-l), where 'C' stands for 'Communist', of course, and 'm-l' for 'Marxist-Leninist'.\", 'From the standpoint of an aleatory realism, it is essential to perceive how the sophist, while seeming to sing the praises of universal difference and exception and the inapplicability of any rational categorial schema, is still committed to the notion that the multiple can itself be characterised, that it can be given the quasi-transcendental lineaments of discourses, language-games, embodiments, strategies, and so on.', \"The offspring, the strong reading, is not only monstrous, it is necessary, and the rape turns out to be an expression of love ('This intensive way of reading [.\", \"The second source for the device of the correlation is – if it is indeed a source – unacknowledged: the reader of Wittgenstein (which Deleuze claimed he wasn't, going as far as calling Wittgenstein, in _Abécédaire_ , an assassin of philosophy) cannot help being reminded of the famous family resemblance sequence, where A resembles B, which resembles C, and so on to N, which has no resemblance to A, the resemblance having drifted, as it does from sibling to sibling or from generation to generation.\", 'In the later works, however, and most notably in the major opus, the style has become as perspicuous as it is explicit.', 'The Baroque fold unfurls all the way to infinity.38\\n\\nThe Deleuze sentence is syntactically simple (it is an excellent example of what is known as hypotactic style), but it has rhythm, a different rhythm from the Badiou sentence: it moves by twists and turns, along a line, or rather two lines in contrast (what the baroque is not, what it is), it proceeds by potentially endless accumulation, the line of flight running towards infinity (note the three dots at the end of the second sentence) and by syntagmatic accretion (note the number of appositions at the end of the third sentence).', 'From this brief summary it appears that the poem is a source for the thinking of the century by the philosopher: it allows the translation that makes the truth of the century explicit, a truth which the poem itself cannot formulate clearly either because it is written in Aesopic language (this may well have been the case with Mandelstam), or because its own path to truth is not propositional (and Badiou has a taste for hermetic poetry, as appears in _Calme bloc ici-bas_ , where one of the characters is writing an interminable poem of resolute, but somewhat tongue-in-cheek, hermeticism, and the hero is a disciple of Mallarmé).', \"In her essay, 'Deleuze et Kafka: l'invention de la littérature mineure',49 Marie-Odile Thirouin points out that the text on which such analysis is based is not Kafka's own, but a collage of fragments from the diaries by Max Brod; that the concept of _littérature mineure_ comes from a translation of the phrase _kleine Literatur_ by Marthe Robert, which introduces a pejorative connotation absent in the original German (and duly inverted by Deleuze and Guattari); and that the position Kafka takes on the subject is not what Deleuze and Guattari claim: he is not dealing with the situation of a Jewish writer in Prague, but of authors writing in Yiddish, not German, in Warsaw, not Prague, or of Czech authors writing in Czech, and for him Jewish literature in Prague, being written in German, belongs to the great German literature, not to a minorisation of it.\", \"This is how Dickens accounts for the scene: Riderhood, between life and death, is no longer a character, only a life, and the other characters, who despise Riderhood, treat this life with the tenderness and care it deserves, which has nothing to do with the 'person' that bears it.\", 'No one has the least regard for the man; with them all, he has been an object of avoidance, suspicion, and aversion; but the spark of life within him is curiously separable from himself now, and they have a deep interest in it, probably because it _is_ life, and they are living and must die.51\\n\\nThere is a contrast between the usual sarcastic tone of the beginning of the passage and the last sentence, where the text acquires a form of ethical seriousness.', 'For Eisenstein, the cinema, not the novel, is the site where we get a glimpse of an externalisation of our inner speech, the old _logos endiathetos_ , the nature of which preoccupied the Greek and medieval philosophers, from Aristotle onwards.6 Except that, for Eisenstein, and for Deleuze after him, _logos endiathetos_ is not a form of mentalese or language of thought (the prevalent solution to the problem of inner speech in the philosophical tradition), nor is it internalised natural language (the minority solution), but an accretion of non-linguistic matter or material: a _masse plastique_ , a shapeless but informable and deformable mass of a-signifying and a-syntactic material, not yet linguistically formed (although already formed semiotically, aesthetically and pragmatically).', \"In the moment of structuralism we have two series, of signifier and signified, separated but parallel, and sparks of meaning emitted at their infrequent conjunction by quilting points ( _points de capiton_ ): this is the structure described in Deleuze's most structuralist text _How Do We Recognize Structuralism?_ and put to work in _The Logic of Sense_ , where it yields a theory of sense in contrast with meaning, that is with good sense and common sense.\", 'At one level, signs, or certain types of signs, involve friendly conversation, appealing to the human faculty of intelligence, which the Greeks called philosophy (a similar account of philosophy is to be found in _What Is Philosophy?_ ).', 'At the other end of the _oeuvre_ , in _Essays Critical and Clinical_ , we catch a final glimpse of the concept, now defined through the twin characteristics of a-grammaticality, or stuttering, and the striving of language towards its limits in silence or in non-linguistic media, images or sounds.', \"Suddenly the words of those hermetic poems come alive (I almost wrote 'make sense', which is exactly what, according to Badiou, they do not), and a coherence emerges around the concepts of event, naming and fidelity.39 But can we go further?\", 'Badiou is one of the rare people, perhaps the only one, capable of making a decision, of solving the paradox the two terms form by firmly excluding one of them, the unexpected one, and turning the other, _logos_ , into the very stuff that poetry is made of.', 'Apart from a few references to the artistic configuration of the novel, culminating in Joyce, and giving the impression that it is now exhausted, the Badiou canon seems to be entirely composed of poets (this is a major difference from Deleuze).', 'After all, Badiou is singular among contemporary philosophers in that he is not only a philosopher but has a recognised artistic position, at least in the field of drama: a notable dramatist himself (in this, his only rival, and predecessor, is Jean-Paul Sartre), he is also a well-known theorist of the theatre, whose positions are at the centre of lively discussion.', \"In his 'Third Sketch for a Manifesto of Affirmationist Art', Badiou takes mischievous delight in the adolescent game of making a list of great twentieth-century artists: Pessoa, Picasso, Schönberg, Brecht, Zadkine, Chaplin, Faulkner, Merle Cunningham; but also Wallace Stevens, Mandelstam, Celan, Berg, Bartok, Pirandello, Claudel and Brancusi; and again, Woolf, Mansfield, Beckett and Malraux.1 I have not quoted the list in full, but we note that, if we except the absence of Proust (for whom, unlike Deleuze, Badiou has little taste) and D. H. Lawrence, this is essentially a modernist canon, vigorously defended in these our postmodern times (the French version of Badiou's text appeared in 2004).2 We also note that for Badiou there is no unified art of literature (unlike painting – represented in the list by Picasso, music – Schönberg, or sculpture – Zadkine), as 'literary' texts are distributed across the poem (Pessoa), the theatre (Brecht) and the novel (Faulkner).\", 'This involves a characterisation of the function of literature, of its essence, and an account of its appearance, a periodisation.', \"The critique, naturally, will start from the double ambiguity of the term: like all deverbal nouns ending in '-tion' (interpretation for instance), it is ambiguous between process and result (the process of representing yields, as its end-result, a representation), and the prefix 're-' is ambiguous between the 're-' of repetition (representation is second degree presentation) and the 're-' of regress (representation is a moving away, and backwards, from presentation).\", 'Lastly, the King, or the MP, is abstracted from the generality of subjects or constituents: this is embodied in the fiction that the MP represents not only the constituents that have voted for him, but the totality of his (the word is significant) constituents.', \"When contrasted with the four equivalent characteristics he ascribes to realism (typicality, individuality, organic plot construction and the presentation of humans as subjects as well as objects of history), they make a fairly clear, if slightly gross or exaggerated, picture: the picture of the opposition between realist representation and modernist presentation (even if the first characteristic ascribed to modernism, reflexivity, is shared, at least in Foucault's interpretation, with classical representation).\", 'We are very close to what Plato, in _The Sophist_ , names as the five supreme genera: Being, Sameness, Movement, Rest, and Other.', \"All curiosity spent.39\\n\\nBadiou gives a brilliant account of the movement of what Gibson, in his reading of Badiou's reading of the passage, calls 'a phenomenology of the event' (and he stresses the importance of the passage for Badiou's understanding of Beckett as a whole).40 This movement goes through the following stages: (1) the 'inspection' of the situation that serves as a starting point, through the normal activity of seeing; (2) in this situation an event occurs, whose presence is marked by a 'sudden sound'; (3) 'the mind awakes', as 'thought is vigilant under the effect of an event'; (4) the reaction of the mind to the event is not one of understanding (the question of interpretation) but of naming: 'how say it'; (5) the name, inscribed in two rare words, an 'uncommon common noun', 'collapsion', and the adjective 'slumberous', bores a hole in ordinary language – and Badiou notes that the putting together of adjective and noun in a single phrase is paradoxical, as the adjective both 'reinforces' and 'enfeebles' the noun; (6) lastly, the naming of the event produces a 'gleam of hope'.\", \"His essay on Melville is entitled 'Bartleby; or, the formula', and his deliberately provocative treatment of Kant, his old philosophical opponent, takes the form of a 'summary' of Kantian philosophy by way of four 'poetic formulas' extracted from Shakespeare, Rimbaud and Kafka.56 The essay on 'Bartleby', as its very title indicates, offers a theory of the Deleuzian formula.\", 'But, unlike Badiou, or to a much greater extent than Badiou, his philosophical reading of literary texts, of Beckett in particular, has convinced him that language was for philosophy an object of thought.', 'He does so in all possible ways, by moving on to other media, like music and the visual arts, by striving for complete silence as the climax, but also the substitute, of language, or, when language persists, by exiling it to the margins of the play, the voice off of commentary or the stage directions.', 'We no longer find the syntactic constructions that yield meaning, the references that propositions convey: names qua words are disjunct atoms, their sequence forms enumerations or lists, not propositions, and their combination is algebraic rather than syntactic.', \"Because there is still an addressee, the audience, and there is still something going on, the process of emergence of those images, which, reflexively, is the process of emergence of language itself, when art takes it to its limits, closer and closer to silence, to which it aspires, and which it achieves with this 'language'.\", \"| G. Deleuze, 'Bartleby, or: The Formula' and 'On Four Poetic Formulas that Might Summarize the Kantian Philosophy', in _Essays Critical and Clinical_ , op.\", \"| Deleuze, 'Bartleby, or: The Formula', op.\", 'The gothic, however, or rather the literary genre the French have called _le fantastique_ , may well lend itself to the type of strong reading our philosophers practise.', \"Its author is the Guatemalan writer Augusto Monterroso:\\n\\nAnd when he woke up, the dinosaur was still looking at him.5\\n\\nAccording to this type of theory, a fantastic story needs the presence of four elements: (1) a world which is our world, which we recognise, and in which the 'inalterable daily legality' reigns; (2) a narrator, the hero of the tale, who is an ordinary inhabitant of the world; (3) a phenomenon, that is an alien element, whose presence threatens the disintegration of the normal world (the word is to be understood in its strong sense, as when we talk of a success that is 'phenomenal'); (4) an encounter between the hero and the phenomenon, which transforms the life of the hero, who becomes a witness to the phenomenon, sometimes with dire consequences to himself, as nobody else believes in the phenomenon and he passes for mad.\", \"In a sense, this is where Badiou the writer reads Badiou the philosopher as, in his latest novel, _Calme bloc ici-bas_ , what we have is a staging of events in the four fields where they may occur: the field of politics (the traces left by a vanquished regime of political commissars, the new historical sequence determined by the movement of the masses – there is a sense in which Badiou's novel is a modern version of Jack London's _The Iron Heel_ , that classic of the revolutionary socialist novel), the field of science (the toucan, or very large, cardinal number which one of the characters constructs), the field of love (a devastating passion is described) and literature (one of the characters is composing a long and particularly abstruse poem, out-Mallarmeing Mallarmé, and we are given extracts).\", \"The event itself, the spark of light of the idea that disperses the cloud of unknowing and shatters established knowledge, is ineffable, and can be captured only in the metaphorical language of light inserted in the discourse of theology – this is indeed Victor Frankenstein's encounter on the road to Damascus.\", 'The continued engagement in this procedure of truth should have induced him to accept the possibility of a race of _Übermenschen_ , by him created, no longer monsters but creatures stronger, more intelligent, and very likely morally better than common-or-garden humanity.', \"7 of _A Thousand Plateaus_ , 'Year Zero: Faciality', Deleuze and Guattari are contrasting their concept of faciality with the concept of gaze, whether in phenomenological garb, as in Sartre, or in psychoanalytic parlance, as in Lacan.\", 'And they are particularly hostile to the psychoanalytic concept of part object:\\n\\nAn approach based on part objects is even worse: it is the approach of a demented experimenter who flays, slices, and anatomizes everything in sight, and then proceeds to sew things randomly back together again.', \"The count, on the other hand, hardly ever talks, and never in the first person (a few of his conversations are reported by Jonathan Harker), and therefore he cannot hope for the reader's sympathy; he is a flat character, a walking embodiment of evil, an object of abhorrence and little else.\", \"The vampire has Being, not becoming, he has strong social identity (which will be the cause of his downfall, as he is too attached to Castle Dracula, his lair), and we saw that he had less difficulty filling in the passport application form than Frankenstein's monster.\", \"Ownership pictures it divided in economic units like internal organs, or like a cow divided into cuts of meat, and certainly such division is one way to organize a food-producing landscape, but it doesn't explain why moors, mountains, and forests should be similarly fenced and divided.\", \"This means that the contrast admits of a third term ('white' is the contrary of 'black' because there are third terms, both black and white, meaning 'grey', or neither black nor white, meaning 'red' or 'blue'), whereas A and D on the one hand and B and C on the other are contradictories, which means that no third term is possible ('white' and 'not white' cover the whole range of possibilities).\", 'But Lucy does not simply stray, she walks, and the impossible name, the unnatural coinage, that designates her and all her kin subverts that doxic order.', 'First, the very name of a philosophy _of_ literature presupposes a hierarchy, whereby philosophy thinks, and literature is thought, as an object for philosophical speculation – literature is merely yet another region over which philosophy exerts its jurisdiction, as a result of which, of course, the literary text is a mere pretext for the development of philosophical analyses that are independent of it, and for the illustration of philosophical concepts whose main field of relevance is located elsewhere.', \"In Badiou, literature is one of the evental fields, one of the fields where procedures of truth occur, and, as we have seen, this implies a superiority of literature over philosophy, which does not produce independent truths, but only thinks, or 'compossibilises', truths produced in other fields.\", 'As we can see, the correlation, and indeed the whole dialectic of form and deformation (which places Deleuze in an old and venerable aesthetic tradition), concerns the art of painting, possibly the art of music, but not, or not directly, the art of literature.', \". .] This entire mechanism of signifiance, with its referral of interpretations, prepares the way for the second, passional subjective, moment, during which Swann's jealousy, querulous delusion, and erotomania develop.\", 'The other lines, of landscapity, picturality, and musicality, also rush toward this catatonic hole and coil around it, bordering it several times.', \"Then Vinteuil's little phrase regains its transcendence and renews its connection with a still more intense, asignifying, and asubjective line of pure musicality.5\\n\\nBuydens comments on this passage by suggesting that it is the most significant formulation, in a condensed form, of Deleuze's aesthetics.\", \"The most likely place is undoubtedly the last chapter of _What Is Philosophy?_ , entitled 'Percept, Affect, and Concept'.6 In that chapter, a concept of art is constructed, in terms corresponding to the high modernist canon which is at the heart of Deleuze's understanding of art.\"]\n",

that needed to be returned or repaired.', 'The shop was small, with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves crammed with every possible genre: mystery, romance, literary novels, biography, history, and more.', 'One middle-aged man in Bermuda shorts, a tank top, and wide leather sandals was browsing through the James Pattersons.', \"Lacy Jordan rushed behind the counter, grabbed Kate's arm, and yanked her toward the door.\", '\"Why, first you\\'re late, and then you rush out the door in some kind of \\'red alert\\' nonsense,\" the older woman was going on.', 'The house, though old, small, and in a state of mild disrepair, had one of the best views in Cambria.', 'In the afternoon, it would be glaring down on her, prompting her to reach for a sun hat, sunglasses, and, ideally, a large umbrella.', \"She'd sold their house in Los Angeles, bought this place, and opened the bookstore.\", 'These days, pretty much everybody—the boutiques, the coffee houses, the souvenir shops, the restaurants, and, of course, the bookstore—offered something special to visitors on the night of the Art Walk.', \"To avoid embarrassing the author—a genuinely nice person and a very talented writer—Kate and Althea had rushed around on the street, finding their friends and using bribes, guilt, and quid-pro-quo promises to fill the modest number of folding chairs they'd set out in the shop.\", \"Their efforts had ultimately failed, and the author had slinked away with a crushed ego, pathetic sales, and a bakery box full of leftover cookies that had been purchased for a crowd that hadn't come.\", 'Gen opened her mouth to say something, closed it, and looked at Kate.', \"You've got to have it with the wine, obviously, or how will you know if Jackson is right about the pairing?\", 'She had just managed to utter the words, \"So, which authors... \" when Jackson Graham tried to barrel his way through the door of the bookstore, found it locked, and pounded on the glass.', 'Kate opened her mouth to speak, closed it, and then said, eloquently, \"Uh... \" She was rendered speechless by her conflicting emotions.', \"Ted's, a somewhat rundown saloon that offered pool, darts, and occasional live music on the weekends, was well off of Main Street, so its clientele was mostly locals rather than the tourists who took over the town every summer.\", 'The girls—Lacy, Gen, and Rose—have been trying to set her up with some guy staying over at the B&B on Washington Street.', 'So she goes out with the guy, has some fun, he moves on, and now she\\'s back in the game.\"', 'The four of them had pulled her

back, sighed, and said she looked stunning.\", \"He began with how they'd met, then proceeded with their courtship, wedding, and early years together.\", 'This is my damned restaurant._\\n\\nAnd so, to spare himself the humiliation of sneaking on his own home territory, where if anyone should be sneaking, it should be _her_ , he took a deep breath, steeled his resolve, and strolled over to her table—it was a stroll rather than a skulk—and presented himself as though he were just doing his job.', 'Lacy, in yoga pants, a tank top, and a baseball cap, looked at Kate in sympathy.', \"I mean, yes, he's somewhat attractive, if you like broad shoulders and thick, wavy hair, and... and raw male magnetism.\", \"I don't have any lingering feelings, or resentment, or anything like that.\",

the others, hesitated, and then decided he had to talk to someone.', \"Lacy, who'd lived in Cambria her entire life with her parents and her extended family right there in town, was tall, blond,

herb roasted pork shoulder with parmesan polenta and a salad of escarole and radicchio with fennel.\", 'Instead, he showed her how to score the skin on the pork roast, directed her in rubbing it with garlic, rosemary, and sage, gave her tips on the best way to roll the roast and tie it with twine, and then nodded with approval as she slid it into the oven.', \"Together they sliced mushrooms, grated cheese, and stretched out the ball of pizza dough he'd brought.\", 'Kate put the plate on a side table between the two Adirondack chairs she kept on the deck, and they ate and sipped wine while the sun washed the sky and the ocean in oranges, pinks, and reds.', '\"Well, you were upset, and I took advantage.\"', 'When those were done, she put them in a decorative bowl, wrapped them, and put them away.', \"She opened an hour earlier and closed an hour later than she did during the rest of the week, and she also liked to provide a little something extra on the weekends: an author appearance, tea and cookies, or maybe story time and a craft in the children's section.\", '\"Althea, wait...\"\\n\\nAlthea fussed around behind the counter, grabbing her purse, her sweater, and the lunch she had packed.', 'She put out a pitcher of iced lemonade and some cups, arranged napkins beside the cookie plate, surveyed her results, and sighed.', '\"I\\'ve gotta go,\" Kate said, and hung up the phone.', \"He'd be busy at Neptune, searing scallops, or doing whatever mysterious magic with food that he did.\", '_Besides cold, calculating, and bitchy, that is._\\n\\n\"Oh, you know.', 'He told her he would pick her up at seven—it would give her just enough time to close the shop, go home, and change clothes, but not enough time to obsess over how the evening would go.', \"Since a full-scale carnival with a Ferris wheel, cotton candy, and a Tilt-a-Whirl was out of the question, she thought she had better focus on what would be practical and doable in less than four weeks' time.\", 'The refuge, less than an hour inland over the rolling hills of Highway 41, had at one time housed a number of lions, an alligator, several species of monkey, a potbelly pig, and a Bengal tiger.', 'She was wearing a pair of pink pleated trousers, a pink button-down blouse, pink sandals, and a full complement of makeup in various shades of pink.', 'There must be more than a hundred bed and breakfasts, hotels, motels, and guest houses here.', \"Kate looked around helplessly, saw Jazzy's little rhinestoned leash sitting on top of his carrier, grabbed it, and thrust it at Angela.\",

became a frenzied whirlwind of barking, snarling, and yipping.', '\"Jackson Graham, this is my father, Thomas Bennet, and his wife, Angela Bennet.\"', \"She was dressed nicely enough—she'd put on a good outfit for work that morning—but she hadn't had the opportunity to shower, change, and primp for him.\", \"She knew that if she started talking about it, she wouldn't stop, and there probably would be tears.\", \"And it also didn't change the fact that the mingled flavors of the puree, the fancy sausage, and the eggplant jam were undeniably appealing.\", \"She went to Jackson's truck, found it unlocked, and retrieved the pink box from the seat.\", 'We get together, we have fun, and then... \" He dropped the wood and made a gesture with his hands that might have indicated a magician\\'s trick— _poof, it\\'s gone_ —or might have indicated an explosion.', 'But also no, because then there was the beach, and talking, and kissing.', \"# 14\\n\\nJackson, Daniel, Ryan, and Will

pierced eyebrow, and what appeared to be eyeliner came into the store.\", 'It had been one week and three days, and they were still ensconced in her bedroom with their snowdrifts of clothing everywhere and their yappy little dog destroying her things: one shoe, a table leg, two books, and a TV remote, at last count.', 'Then she looked up, spotted Jackson, and smiled in surprise.', 'She was sitting with Gen, Rose, and Lacy at The Wild Orchid, a sushi place a block off Main Street, gesturing with a piece of California roll pinched between two chopsticks.', 'There could be age divisions: adult, young adult, and children.', 'He leaned in for a hello kiss, and he smelled like soap, mouthwash, and essence of Jackson Graham.', 'He poured more for both of them, sat down, and folded his arms on top of the table.', 'He took it, stood up, and enfolded her in his arms.', \"They talked on the phone, texted, and emailed a lot, but it wasn't getting the job done for either of them.\", \"While part of Cambria's charm was that it lacked chain restaurants, drive-throughs, and many of the other establishments that stole a town's character and made it look just like everywhere else, there were times when you just wanted to shop at a well-equipped grocery store or get a Starbucks Frappuccino.\", 'It had been updated in the interim, no doubt, but it retained a feeling of nostalgia, of grandeur, and it evoked the spirit of the thousands of helpings of sticky fake butter and spilled sodas that had gone before.', 'They walked across the street to a place that sold hamburgers, hot dogs, and french fries through an ancient-looking window surrounded by peeling paint.', \"She wasn't supposed to have normal, adult desires, and she certainly wasn't supposed to assert those desires.\", 'She thought about that, and about the various carnal delights Date Five would have to offer, on Friday night after work as she, Gen, Rose, and Lacy discussed their plans for Art Walk the next day.', 'As she walked to her car, she saw the man park the car, get out, and stand with his hands on his hips, looking at her house.', 'Kate arranged the canapes, the napkins, and the plastic drink cups; Fury straightened the rows of folding chairs; and Cassidy McLean, who had arrived right on time toting Samantha in a plastic cat carrier, was arranging a stack of her books on a table for signing.', 'Kate, Jackson, Cassidy, Angela, Thomas, Samantha, and Jazzy all were crowded into the tiny back room.', '\"Screw Date Five,\" she said, and launched herself at him.', 'One second they were feet apart, talking, and the next, she had her body wrapped around him, her mouth on his in an explosion of desire.', 'His hands were on her, all over her, and he roughly pulled her skirt up until it was bunched around her waist.', 'Kate asked, her hands planted on her hips, empowered by sexual satisfaction, adrenaline, and not a small amount of pure Jackson Graham.', 'Without looking back, Kate went to her Honda, got in, and fired up the engine.', 'She unlocked it, went inside, and headed across the living room toward the big sliding glass door that opened out onto the balcony.', 'Her arms full of shirts, pants, shoes, belts, and the various pieces of their wardrobes, she went out onto the balcony and heaved everything over the side.', 'No home, no money, no father, and no self-respect.', \"Today she'd have to go to work and fix everything—the mess, the damage, the broken things, and especially the rampant small-town talk about everything that had taken place.\", 'Rose and Lacy each called, of course, and it seemed that Cambrians from all over town just happened to stop in her store, wanting to chat.', \"It had changed as she'd learned that he loved books; as he'd listened to her—really listened—about her mother, and her father, and her complicated feelings about them; as he'd tried with an endearing earnestness to treat her differently than the other women he'd known; and as he'd touched her and brought her to heights of desire and pleasure she'd never experienced.\", \"He cited the items he'd ordered—two appetizers, two entrees, and three desserts—and it clicked.\", 'The day was stunning, with clear skies, cool temperatures, and light breezes.', 'Pure, giddy happiness, and tenderness, and something else that might have been love.', 'He finally, finally penetrated her, and she gasped with pleasure, with satisfaction.', 'She was overwhelmed, overjoyed, and a tear slid down her cheek.', 'He paid the pizza guy with a twenty that was still soggy, and they went back onto the deck and ate the pepperoni, sausage, and black olive pizza straight from the box.', 'Elway ushered Jackson through the restaurant, which was sleek with copper-plated ceilings, pale blue walls, and white tuxedo-style banquettes providing seating for blond wood tables.', 'Elway showed Jackson around, introduced him to the kitchen staff, and then ushered him back into an office resplendent with hardwood floors, natural light, and a highly polished mahogany desk.', 'Elway pulled out a copy of the current menu, and they went over it item by item, discussing the good, the very good, and the outdated.', 'Whatever that mysterious pixie dust was that made you know someone was right for you—that they were the one—it had been sprinkled over Kate in generous, heaping handfuls, and no amount of logic could change that.', \"Gen, Rose, and Lacy scooped Kate out of her shop, whisked her off to Rose's house, took away her cell phone so that Jackson couldn't call from San Francisco and tell her painful lies, and did that thing women do when one of their own has been heartbroken.\", '\"The point is, he did that, and now he\\'s doing this.', 'Kate fumbled around in the kitchen, found some Tylenol, and took a couple to combat her headache.', 'He went home, showered, and went downstairs to start his shift.', 'But tonight, he heard nothing except
