24,"And we understand why Badiou defines the task of philosophy (a modest but nevertheless an essential one) as the 'compossibilisation' of procedures of truth in the four fields (science, art, politics and love) where truths, in the emphatic plural, emerge, why philosophy is practised only 'under the conditions' of truths produced in other fields, the fields in which, unlike in philosophy, events occur.",False,198

24,"In _The Logic of Sense_ , where the two levels are articulated, the portmanteau or esoteric word, as operator of disjunctive synthesis, plays the same role as the empty square in Deleuze's structuralist theory of sense and meaning33 – an element that glides along the two series of signifier and signified, itself devoid of meaning but achieving meaning in the synthesis it operates.",False,79

24,"of recognition and _prise de conscience_.34 The disjunctive synthesis, Deleuze and Guattari add, is not a synthesis of contradictory terms as in Hegelian sublation ( _Aufhebung_ ), it reaffirms the individual separate existence of the terms it conjoins, it remains open and not closed in the circularity of the dialectic.",False,78
24,"It is connected with the main concepts of his ontology (series and empty square; flows and cuts; events) and of his philosophy of language (esoteric words and the stuttering of language, floating signifier and the distinction between meaning and sense).",False,205
24,"Above all, it is the very embodiment of Deleuze's notorious hostility to the Hegelian system: the three syntheses are Deleuze's answer to the Hegelian dialectic, and the function of the disjunctive synthesis, which is affirmative and resists closure, is to replace and deny the third moment of the dialectic, the moment of unity of the contradictory terms through sublation.",False,264

24,"But this disjunctive synthesis is the ruin of intentionality.48  It is well-known that Badiou's reading of Deleuze, contrary to an established critical tradition, makes him a philosopher of the One (thus imposing on him a form of Platonism), rather than the thinker of anarchic multiplicities, processes of becoming, complex assemblages of machines or enunciations, lines of flight and all-pervading difference.",False,381
24,"That there is a case for such a reading, the above quotation makes clear: Deleuze appears to be a consistently Spinozist philosopher, the disjunctive synthesis being the name of the (non-) relation between the various modes of the one substance, a relation deeper than the intentional relation between name and thing, sign and referent.",False,322

24,"There are two possible sources for the device, the first of which is fully acknowledged by Deleuze, in his essay on structuralism:28 the linguistic chain is organised in two parallel series (of words and things, of signifier and signified), along which the empty square circulates, producing meaning.",False,224
24,"The second source for the device of the correlation is – if it is indeed a source – unacknowledged: the reader of Wittgenstein (which Deleuze claimed he wasn't, going as far as calling Wittgenstein, in _Abécédaire_ , an assassin of philosophy) cannot help being reminded of the famous family resemblance sequence, where A resembles B, which resembles C, and so on to N, which has no resemblance to A, the resemblance having drifted, as it does from sibling to sibling or from generation to generation.",True,352

24,"The Baroque fold unfurls all the way to infinity.38  The Deleuze sentence is syntactically simple (it is an excellent example of what is known as hypotactic style), but it has rhythm, a different rhythm from the Badiou sentence: it moves by twists and turns, along a line, or rather two lines in contrast (what the baroque is not, what it is), it proceeds by potentially endless accumulation, the line of flight running towards infinity (note the three dots at the end of the second sentence) and by syntagmatic accretion (note the number of appositions at the end of the third sentence).",True,271
24,"Hence a mode of reading which is less assertive but in a way more violent: not so much the violence of decision (there is a strong form of decisionism in Badiou, and not only in his political philosophy) as of deliberate misprision, the price to pay for genuine creation (that there is a form of creationism – but not in the usual meaning among biologists – is at the centre of Peter Hallward's reading of Deleuze).40 From those philosophical contrasts we can derive the opposition between thesis and correlation (one is certainly more systematic and assertive than the other), the Badiou sentence and the Deleuze sentence and the classical versus the Baroque style.",False,597
24,"His first published books were two novels, _Almagestes_ and _Portulans_.41 _Calme bloc ici-bas_ , his third novel, was published eleven years after _Being and Event_ , and there is a sense in which it is informed by the system: it reads like a yarn, complete with disappearances, pursuits and _coups de théâtre_ , but the 'events' narrated are, more often than not, events in the sense of Badiou, radically new occurrences in the fields of politics, science and love (for instance, we meet a mathematician who is trying to improve on Cantor).",False,55
24,"And when Badiou appeals to literature as a condition for his philosophy, it is to defend a canon which is limited (his favourite, should I say his only, authors are Beckett, Mallarmé, Rimbaud, Pessoa and Mandelstam – Deleuze's taste is much more catholic), limited to poetry, as we have just noted (Beckett, for instance, is treated more as a poet than a playwright) and typically high modernist: you don't catch Badiou mentioning Gaston Leroux, that ancestor of the closed-room whodunit, as Deleuze does in his essay of 1966, 'Philosophie de la série noire'.42  With Deleuze, on the other hand, we find no explicitly literary writing – philosophy is an obsession, and there is no leaving it, even for art – but a proliferation of literary references, as well as a more general interest in other arts.",False,199
24,"There is a sense in which the development of his interest in art goes from literature to a more general form of artistic semiosis: such is Anne Sauvagnargues's thesis in her _Deleuze et l'art_.43 But she immediately concedes that the interest in literature was a lifelong passion in Deleuze (the last book he published in his lifetime, _Essays Critical and Clinical_ ,44 is largely devoted to literature).",False,352
24,"Thus, in contrast with Badiou's, Deleuze's canon is (1) without bounds (someone has produced a concordance of literary allusions in Deleuze's works: there are 279 entries);45 (2) without generic bounds, as Deleuze can philosophise about any type of literature, from the detective story, as we have seen, to avant-garde poets like Gherasim Luca, taking in the classical novel of the nineteenth century (Dickens, Zola) as well as contemporary drama from Beckett to Carmelo Bene; (3) with a national slant, as Deleuze is particularly keen on Anglo-American literature, having devoted most of his _Logic of Sense_ to Lewis Carroll, and entitled a section of his _Dialogues_ with Claire Parnet 'On the superiority of Anglo-American literature' – Crane, Lawrence, Melville, Kerouac, Fitzgerald are among his favourite authors; (4) with the same high modernist slant as Badiou: the entries on Artaud and Lawrence are among the longest in the index, and the longer books are devoted to Proust, Kafka and Beckett.",False,991

24,"From this brief summary it appears that the poem is a source for the thinking of the century by the philosopher: it allows the translation that makes the truth of the century explicit, a truth which the poem itself cannot formulate clearly either because it is written in Aesopic language (this may well have been the case with Mandelstam), or because its own path to truth is not propositional (and Badiou has a taste for hermetic poetry, as appears in _Calme bloc ici-bas_ , where one of the characters is writing an interminable poem of resolute, but somewhat tongue-in-cheek, hermeticism, and the hero is a disciple of Mallarmé).",True,591
24,"The outcome of the reading is the formulation of a number of philosophical theses on the century, the last and perhaps the most important of which is that the century was a century of the poetics of the wait and of the threshold: what the poem does achieve is that it enables us to think the century anew, by being a source of further theses.",False,106

24,"On the one hand we are closer to traditional literary analysis, and Badiou believes in syntax as the guarantee of the meaning of the text (in his essay on Mallarmé's 'method', in _Conditions_ , he claims that the 'guiding thread for clarification' of the poem is syntactic;53 in _Calme bloc ici-bas_ , he has one of the characters, a faintly ridiculous grammarian, exclaim: 'syntax is the only protection  _garde-fou_ ] when we are seized with poetic fury').54 We have a mixture of fidelity and exploitation, which Badiou describes in the following terms: the poem thinks, but it does not know – it requires philosophy to reach the knowledge the poem provokes but does not master; on the other hand, of course, it is such thinking, and such thinking only, that produces truths.",True,730

24,"In the very first pages of _Logic of Worlds_ he calls him 'his master' and claims that the first proposition he states: 'There are only bodies and languages, except that there are truths', is formulated in Mallarmean style.1 And he has been a consistent reader of Mallarmé: in _Théorie du sujet_ , we find a close commentary of two sonnets;2 in _Being and Event_ , the nineteenth 'meditation' is devoted to a reading of Mallarmé's famous spatial poem, 'Un coup de dés jamais n'abolira le hasard';3 the early collection of essays, _Conditions_ , contains an essay on Mallarmé's 'method'4 in which the same two sonnets and another poem, _Prose (pour des Esseintes)_ , are analysed; in _Handbook of Inaesthetics_ , Mallarmé is evoked in two essays, in a discussion with the Polish poet Czeslaw Milosz and through a comparison with the Arab poet Labîd ben Rabi'a;5 finally, at the end of _Logic of Worlds_ , in a section entitled 'Commentaries and Digressions', Badiou, in reminiscent mode, evokes his intellectual debt to both Mallarmé and Beckett ('thinking under condition of Mallarmé', as he calls it) and even states that the whole of his philosophy has perhaps consisted of an attempt to understand the works of those two authors – this is no mean claim.6  So Badiou reads Mallarmé, compulsively and in detail, even if his is a restricted corpus (two sonnets and two longer poems): it is obvious he has a great book on Mallarmé in him.",False,1101
24,"But it is equally true, as he himself insists, that Mallarmé reads Badiou: the shipwreck, the Mallarmean image which he privileges in his reading, is the poetic inscription of a Badiou event ('The ""shipwreck"" alone gives us the allusive debris from which (in the one of the site) the indecidable multiple of the event is composed'),7 and the cast of dice as event is nothing but the event of the production of the very symbol of an event, a second degree event ('The event in question in _A Cast of Dice_ .",False,333
24,"The stakes of casting dice ""from the bottom of a shipwreck"" are those of making an event out of the thought of the event').8 This attitude to the poem is entirely consistent with Badiou's concepts of truth and event: procedures of truth only occur in the four fields of science, art, love and politics, the four conditions under which philosophy, which does not produce truths itself but only 'compossibilises' the truths produced in other fields, operates.",False,288
24,"And the poem is sometimes given an even more important role to play, as matheme and poem are the archetypal conditions under which philosophy develops (a situation consistent with Badiou's lifelong interest in mathematics, which he ascribes to the influence of his father, and his lifelong passion for poetry, which he ascribes to the influence of his mother) – it is either an event itself, the event of the inscription of the event, or part of an artistic configuration where the event occurs (the event, in that case, is a group of poems, or works of art): 'In the final analysis, the pertinent unit for the thinking of art as an immanent and singular truth is neither the work nor the author, but rather the artistic configuration initiated by an evental rupture').9 The seriousness of the enterprise of reading Mallarmé therefore is not in doubt: the question that arises is not why Badiou reads Mallarmé (that he finds in his poetry an inscription of the very event of which he constructs the concept, that, in that sense, it is Mallarmé who reads Badiou, is abundantly clear), but _how_ he reads him.",False,79
24,"The first reading occurs in _Théorie du sujet_ , and the pedagogic aspect is partly explained by the fact that the book is the transcription (somewhat rewritten, I suspect) of an oral seminar: there are moments when Badiou is 'in front of the blackboard', drawing diagrams or clarifying things to a benighted audience.10 Two sonnets, usually known by their first lines ('A la nue accablante tu' and 'Ses purs ongles très haut dédiant leur onyx'), are presented in two sessions of the seminar.",False,272

24,"In his 'Third Sketch for a Manifesto of Affirmationist Art', Badiou takes mischievous delight in the adolescent game of making a list of great twentieth-century artists: Pessoa, Picasso, Schönberg, Brecht, Zadkine, Chaplin, Faulkner, Merle Cunningham; but also Wallace Stevens, Mandelstam, Celan, Berg, Bartok, Pirandello, Claudel and Brancusi; and again, Woolf, Mansfield, Beckett and Malraux.1 I have not quoted the list in full, but we note that, if we except the absence of Proust (for whom, unlike Deleuze, Badiou has little taste) and D. H. Lawrence, this is essentially a modernist canon, vigorously defended in these our postmodern times (the French version of Badiou's text appeared in 2004).2 We also note that for Badiou there is no unified art of literature (unlike painting – represented in the list by Picasso, music – Schönberg, or sculpture – Zadkine), as 'literary' texts are distributed across the poem (Pessoa), the theatre (Brecht) and the novel (Faulkner).",False,330
24,"And of course, we note that the core of the intersection of Deleuze's and Badiou's canons is Beckett, to whom they both devoted a separate, if brief, text and to whose work they come back repeatedly in the course of their _oeuvre_.3 The English version of Badiou's collected texts on Beckett has three essays on top of the text of the short book,4 and the index of literary references in Deleuze's works has a whole page and no less than fifty-two entries.5  The adoption of a modernist literary canon is not original to Badiou and Deleuze: they share it with the so-called 'poststructuralist' philosophers, a category that includes Derrida, Lyotard and Foucault, that sometimes includes Deleuze (a somewhat doubtful ascription) and emphatically fails to include Badiou (for whom they are the modern Sophists).",False,154

24,"The second characteristic, the fragmentation of literary modernism (juxtaposition or _montage_ ), finds consonance not only in Deleuze's keen interest in the cinema ( _montage_ is no longer a mere technical device, it becomes a philosophical concept), but in his conception of the text as rhizome (rather than a tree, with univocal branching causality and hierarchy, as in Chomsky's conception of syntax), with concomitant effects of juxtaposition (Deleuze, being a philosopher of surfaces, is the philosopher of cartography and _calque_ ), of intensities and regimes of signs.",False,555
24,"Rancière, however, has argued that Badiou cannot be called an unqualified modernist because of his rejection of the role of language in art (of the languages of art) in favour of the Platonist Idea, but that he is nevertheless a 'twisted modernist' in his insistence on subtraction, an anti-mimetic position that absolves art of any obligation to imitate external reality, and in his assertion that the truths of art are proper to it: for Rancière these are two characteristics of modernism, which makes Badiou an 'undoubted', if twisted, modernist.25  It is no wonder, therefore, that Badiou is an obsessive reader of modernist literature, with two qualifications: his corpus is almost exclusively poetic (in spite of the presence of Faulkner, Woolf and Mansfield in the list quoted above, he does not really engage with the modernist novel – as we saw, a paradox for an author who is a novelist himself) and not exclusively modernist as Mallarmé and Rimbaud figure prominently in it.",False,750

24,"All curiosity spent.39  Badiou gives a brilliant account of the movement of what Gibson, in his reading of Badiou's reading of the passage, calls 'a phenomenology of the event' (and he stresses the importance of the passage for Badiou's understanding of Beckett as a whole).40 This movement goes through the following stages: (1) the 'inspection' of the situation that serves as a starting point, through the normal activity of seeing; (2) in this situation an event occurs, whose presence is marked by a 'sudden sound'; (3) 'the mind awakes', as 'thought is vigilant under the effect of an event'; (4) the reaction of the mind to the event is not one of understanding (the question of interpretation) but of naming: 'how say it'; (5) the name, inscribed in two rare words, an 'uncommon common noun', 'collapsion', and the adjective 'slumberous', bores a hole in ordinary language – and Badiou notes that the putting together of adjective and noun in a single phrase is paradoxical, as the adjective both 'reinforces' and 'enfeebles' the noun; (6) lastly, the naming of the event produces a 'gleam of hope'.",True,813
24,"Which also means that in this regard it is comparable with every other poem that allows itself to be bent to the same demonstration, to be assigned the same task of speaking twice, to say the same event of the Idea twice: the first time as a maxim, the second time as an enigma.44  What Rancière is suggesting is that Badiou's reading method always yields the same result, whatever the poem or literary text he reads: that it finds what it wanted to find, namely the event and its naming, at the cost of 'bending' the text to its 'demonstration'.",False,390

24,"But it is entirely coherent with Deleuze's general philosophical agenda of overturning the representative image of thought, represented here by the chain of concepts, figurative – representation – narrative – perspective, hence a history of modern painting according to Deleuze, with its three moments of abstract art where form is dominant, informal art where form is dissolved and chaos reigns, and deformative art as exemplified by Deleuze's favourite painters, Bacon and Cézanne.",False,470

24,"Then Vinteuil's little phrase regains its transcendence and renews its connection with a still more intense, asignifying, and asubjective line of pure musicality.5  Buydens comments on this passage by suggesting that it is the most significant formulation, in a condensed form, of Deleuze's aesthetics.",True,120
24,"The most likely place is undoubtedly the last chapter of _What Is Philosophy?_ , entitled 'Percept, Affect, and Concept'.6 In that chapter, a concept of art is constructed, in terms corresponding to the high modernist canon which is at the heart of Deleuze's understanding of art.",True,106
24,"The task of the artist is not to express her mediocre feelings and trite perceptions, but to extract from them blocs of sensation, to invent and present affects and percepts.",False,140
24,"This is why Deleuze devotes a significant part of the chapter to a critique of Merleau-Ponty's concept of 'flesh', that 'final avatar of phenomenology' (p. 178), which is too dependent on the lived human body to support affect and percept, since they are non-human, impersonal, pre-individual and non-subjective (in which they are like haecceities).",False,292
24,"Aesthetic figures are not conceptual personae, affects and percepts are not concepts: the domain of art is circumscribed not only by the general title of the book (the question mark concerns philosophy before it does art) and by the very title of the chapter, which ends on the important word, 'concept'.",False,54
24,"Deleuze, of course, is not suggesting that art is a marginal and subordinate practice, and the claim he makes for it has nothing to do with classical mimesis, adornment or entertainment.",False,168
24,"No wonder the chapter ends on a thesis, the high modernist flavour of which will not escape us: the compounds of sensations that make up the work of art deterritorialise the system of opinion, or _doxa_ , in other words the dominant perceptions and affections within a natural, historical and social situation (p.197).",False,288
24,"What we have reached with the end of this argument is a concept of style, Deleuze's concept of style, where _doxa_ is subverted by taking language to its limits, towards silence or towards images, through stuttering, rolling and pitching.",False,177
24,"All this, according to Rancière, defines an aesthetics which, if not new (Deleuze is a representative of the aesthetic regime of art), is at least genuine, as it accounts for the work of art not in terms of _phusis_ (its nature, different from the nature of ordinary objects, as it is the embodiment of a transcendent idea), not in terms of _techne_ (the representative regime of art describes the work in the terms of the techniques used to give form to the raw material of sensation), but in terms of _aisthesis_ , in terms of affects extracted from ordinary sensations, disfiguring our conventional representations, finding truth and thought in pure sensation as manifesting the presence of a spirit or idea that is immanent in it.",False,632
24,"Yet, on the other hand, what finally comes out of this is siphoned into the reservoir of concepts that, from the very beginning of his work, Deleuze has established and linked together.13  In other words, Deleuze exploits art, whether the cinema or literature, by finding in the works of art what he is bent on finding in them: the main concepts of his own philosophy.",False,245
24,"Badiou goes on to mention two other schemas for thinking art in its relation to philosophy, the _Romantic schema_ whereby art is the sole source of truth, and the _classical schema_ , represented by Aristotle, whereby art is incapable of truth and its essence is purely mimetic (in which this schema is similar to the didactic schema), but it does not matter, as art lays no claim to truth: its end is not cognitive but ethical – it is _catharsis_ , the purgation and overcoming of passion.",False,463
24,"The account of the supersession of aesthetics by inaesthetics, both in Badiou and in his disciple, creates a certain uneasiness.",False,77
24,"It is the only way of ensuring the necessary and impossible coincidence of two contradictory requirements: the Platonist/anti-Platonist requirement of a poem that teaches us about the courage of truth on the one hand, and the modernist requirement of the autonomy of art on the other.22  We shall take Rancière's strictures with the usual calm: what he is describing is what I have attempted to account for under the name of 'strong reading', which both Badiou and Deleuze practise with the same zest.",False,460
24,"For Deleuze, style lies in the deformation, small agrammaticalities and intensive line of syntax whereby literature becomes not the representation but the expression of life, not the individual or personal life of a character or an author, but _a_ life, in its non-human, a-subjective and pre-personal development or becoming, an intensity on the plane of immanence which literature draws on chaos and constructs into a plane of composition.",False,193

<article class=""article article--hasToC"">   <h1>Screen APIs</h1> <p>The Crosswalk Project simplifies the difficult task of making an application work well on a small screen, with the same look and feel as a native application.</p> <p>Some of the most common screen-related issues on mobile devices are:</p> <ul> <li>Fitting the application to the &quot;real&quot; screen width and height.</li> <li>Locking the screen orientation to the one preferred for the application.</li> <li>Showing an application in fullscreen mode with no system toolbars.</li> <li>Using different layouts or assets depending on screen size.</li> <li>Showing a launch screen while an application is loading.</li> </ul> <p>A number of solutions for such issues have surfaced over the last few years, either as de facto &quot;standards&quot; (e.g.",False,6551
394,"However, many browsers and web views lag behind these standards.</p> <p>By contrast, one major benefit of Crosswalk is that many of these evolving standards are implemented and available for use <em>right now</em>.",False,22
394,"However, there are other situations where it is important to understand these nuances; for example, if you want your game to look identical on different devices, you will have to pay attention to screen densities.</p> <p>To help in these situations, the <a href=""/documentation/tutorials/screens/screen_measurements.html"">screen measurements page</a> explains the terminology, including units and measurements, which are relevant when dealing with heterogenous screens in detail.</p> <p>You may also find it useful to refer to <a href=""http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/hidpi/"">this article</a> about working with the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element on HiDPI (aka retina) displays.</p> <h2>The game</h2> <p>The game used in this article is a side-scrolling dodge game set in space.",False,392
394,"In the code above, the height and width are fixed; but they can be set dynamically based on the size of the screen (see later).</p> </li> <li><p>The container has <code>position: relative</code> set in the CSS, and the child screens have <code>position: absolute</code>.",False,29
394,"Most phone browsers still work this way: for example, the HTC One X I have for testing reports its width as 980px, while its actual physical width is 360px.</p> <p>Around the same time, web developers and designers changed their approach, designing websites which would display differently depending on device capabilities.",False,200
394,"Contemporary developers also often employ a <a href=""http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first"">mobile first</a> philosophy, ensuring a website is highlighy functional first and foremost on small form factors, with added bells and whistles (typically, more and larger graphics) on bigger form factors.</p> <p>Where these two roads meet is at an awkward crossroads: developers are trying hard to provide sites tailored specifically for small screen devices; but small screen devices apply an artificial zoom which makes device screens appear larger than they are.",False,232

394,"The next section describes a more complex alternative which uses resizing plus selective scaling of game assets.</p> <h3>Approach 2: Resize the game</h3> <p>This approach requires a more extensive reworking of the CSS for the game, as it affects the positioning, size and appearance of every element.",False,267
394,"(This is a bit confusing, as the height and width attributes of a canvas are different from the CSS height and width of its <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element.",False,39
