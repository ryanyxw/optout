"In his 'Third Sketch for a Manifesto of Affirmationist Art', Badiou takes mischievous delight in the adolescent game of making a list of great twentieth-century artists: Pessoa, Picasso, Schönberg, Brecht, Zadkine, Chaplin, Faulkner, Merle Cunningham; but also Wallace Stevens, Mandelstam, Celan, Berg, Bartok, Pirandello, Claudel and Brancusi; and again, Woolf, Mansfield, Beckett and Malraux.1 I have not quoted the list in full, but we note that, if we except the absence of Proust (for whom, unlike Deleuze, Badiou has little taste) and D. H. Lawrence, this is essentially a modernist canon, vigorously defended in these our postmodern times (the French version of Badiou's text appeared in 2004).2 We also note that for Badiou there is no unified art of literature (unlike painting – represented in the list by Picasso, music – Schönberg, or sculpture – Zadkine), as 'literary' texts are distributed across the poem (Pessoa), the theatre (Brecht) and the novel (Faulkner)."
